Let me summarize what we know so far:\n\nProject: Project Management System\nTarget Audience: Enterprise teams\nKey Objective: Improve collaboration and productivity\nMain Features:\n- User tracking\n- Task management\n- Reporting\n\nTo further develop the Vision Document, let's explore each component in more detail:\n\n1. Project Purpose and Objectives:\n   - What specific problems or challenges do enterprise teams face that this project management system aims to solve?\n   - How will improving collaboration and productivity benefit the target users and the business as a whole?\n\n2. Target Users and Stakeholders:\n   - Can you provide more details about the enterprise teams who will use this system? What are their roles and responsibilities?\n   - Are there any other stakeholders, such as project sponsors or executives, who have a vested interest in the project's success?\n\n3. Solution Scope and Capabilities:\n   - What specific capabilities should the user tracking feature include? For example, user roles, permissions, activity logging, etc.\n   - How do you envision the task management feature working? Will it include task assignment, deadlines, priority levels, and progress tracking?\n   - What types of reports and analytics should the reporting feature generate? Are there any specific metrics or KPIs that are important to track?\n\n4. Value Proposition and Benefits:\n   - How will this project management system differentiate itself from existing solutions in the market?\n   - What tangible benefits will users experience by adopting this system, such as increased efficiency, better resource allocation, or improved project success rates?\n\n5. Success Criteria and Metrics:\n   - What key metrics will be used to measure the success of the project management system? For example, user adoption rate, project completion time, team satisfaction scores, etc.\n   - Are there any specific targets or goals you want to achieve within a certain timeframe after launching the system?\n\nAnswering these questions will help us flesh out the Vision Document and ensure it comprehensively captures the project's purpose, scope, and value proposition. Feel free to provide any additional insights or requirements you have in mind.\n\nOnce we have gathered all the necessary information, I'll draft an initial version of the Vision Document for your review. We can then iterate on it together to refine the content and ensure it effectively communicates the project vision to all stakeholders.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on the questions above, and we can continue building out the Vision Document collaboratively.",
