Creating a clear and compelling vision is a critical first step in the requirements engineering process. \n\nTo get started, let's discuss the key elements that should be included:\n\nHigh-Level Objectives:\n- What is the primary purpose and goal of this software project? \n- What overarching business or strategic objectives will it support?\n\nProblem Definition & Scope:\n- What specific problems or pain points will this software aim to solve? \n- What is the intended scope of the solution? What's in and out of scope?\n\nTarget Users & Stakeholders:\n- Who are the primary intended users of the software? \n- What other key stakeholders need to be considered (e.g. executives, partners, etc.)?\n\nSuccess Criteria & Benefits:\n- What does success look like for this project? How will it be measured?\n- What are the expected benefits to the business and to end users?\n\nCompetitive Landscape:\n- How does this software compare to existing solutions in the market?\n- What unique value proposition will differentiate it?\n\nProviding some initial thoughts on these topics will help me understand the high-level direction. I can then work on drafting the first version of the vision document for further discussion and refinement.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification on the types of information I'm looking for at this stage. I'm happy to brainstorm and ask follow-up questions to make sure we create a vision that resonates with all stakeholders.",
