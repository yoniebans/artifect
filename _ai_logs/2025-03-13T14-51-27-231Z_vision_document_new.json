Let's start by gathering insights into the following areas:\n\n1. Project Objectives: \n- What are the primary objectives and goals this software project aims to achieve? \n- How will this project provide value to the organization and its stakeholders?\n\n2. Problem Statement:\n- What specific problems or pain points will this software project address? \n- How do these problems impact the business, users, or other stakeholders?\n\n3. Solution Scope: \n- At a high level, what is the envisioned solution to address the identified problems?\n- What are the key features, functionalities, or capabilities the solution will provide?\n\n4. Target Users:\n- Who are the primary users or user groups that will interact with the software? \n- What are their key characteristics, needs, and expectations?\n\n5. Business Outcomes:\n- What specific business outcomes or benefits are expected from this project? \n- How will the project contribute to the organization's strategic goals and success?\n\n6. Competitive Landscape:\n- Are there existing solutions or competitors in the market that address similar problems?\n- How will this project differentiate itself and provide unique value?\n\nGathering this foundational information will help shape a compelling vision that clearly articulates the project's purpose, value proposition, and alignment with organizational objectives. Please provide as much detail as possible for each area, and I'll be happy to draft an initial version of the Vision Document for further review and refinement.\n\nLet me know if you have any other specific considerations or constraints that should be factored into the vision. I'm looking forward to collaborating on this important artifact and setting a clear direction for the project.",
